# Covid-Data-Analyst-Portfolio-Project
In this project we will be using SQL to do some Data Exploration, then visualize the data in Tableau

Link to Dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

We tried to find an answer to following questions:

1. What is the global total cases, global total deaths, global death percentage due to Covid?

2. What is the countinents' total death numbers due to Covid?

3. What is the country base population, highest infection number in countries and percent of population infected in countries?

4. What is the time period of highest infection numbers among countries with population, and percent of population infected information?

The tableau visualization can be seen from here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alper5134/viz/CovidDashboard_16368104497580/Dashboard1
